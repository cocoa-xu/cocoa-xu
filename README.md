### Hi there üëã

I'm Cocoa, I am interested in a lot of things!

### About me

- My daily programming languages are C/C++, Elixir and Python.
- I also use other languages/frameworks like Java(Type)Script/Phoneix/Vue.JS to build my own blog.

### Repositories maintained by me

- **[evision](https://github.com/cocoa-xu/evision)**

  [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) BEAM and Elixir bindings.

- **[tflite_beam](https://github.com/cocoa-xu/tflite_beam)** and **[tflite_elixir](https://github.com/cocoa-xu/tflite_elixir)**

  TensorFlow Lite BEAM and Elixir bindings with optional EdgeTPU support.

  - **[libedgetpu](https://github.com/cocoa-xu/libedgetpu)** and **[libcoral](https://github.com/cocoa-xu/libcoral)**

    Providing EdgeTPU support such as Google Coral.

    Forked from [google-coral/libedgetpu](https://github.com/google-coral/libedgetpu) and [google-coral/libcoral](https://github.com/google-coral/libcoral) respectively, independently maintained for multiply CPU architectures with latest TensorFlow version.

  - **[bazel-zig-cc](https://github.com/cocoa-xu/bazel-zig-cc)**

    Providing `aarch64-linux-musl` and `riscv64-linux-musl` compiling support for libedgetpu.

    Forked from [motiejus/bazel-zig-cc](https://git.sr.ht/~motiejus/bazel-zig-cc) and added support for aforementioned CPU architectures.

- **[ExPTY](https://github.com/cocoa-xu/ExPTY)**

  An Elixir library that provides pseudoterminals. Users can interact with the spawned process using Elixir code.

  Adapted from [microsoft/node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty) and modified for Erlang and Elixir.

- **[cc_precompiler](https://github.com/cocoa-xu/cc_precompiler)**

  An Elixir library that enables precompliation feature for [elixir_make](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir_make)

- **[dll_loader_helper_beam](https://github.com/cocoa-xu/dll_loader_helper_beam)**

  A BEAM library that adds a directory to dynamic DLL search path on Windows.

- **[elixir-nx/stb_image](https://github.com/elixir-nx/stb_image)**

  A tiny Elixir image library using stb_image as the backend.

- **[elixir-explorer/adbc](https://github.com/elixir-explorer/adbc)**

  Elixir bindings for Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC).

Note that there're many other people who have collaborated/contributed to these repositories above. Without them it would be very hard or impossible for these libraries to be existed or function normally. 

Also, I'd like to express my gratitude to whom is sponsoring/sponsored me on GitHub! üíö üíô üíú üíõ ‚ù§Ô∏è
